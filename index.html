    <img src="IMG_0896.jpeg" alt="My test image" width="150" height="200">
    <p>Welcome to my website. The purpose of this site is to engage with potential employers and clients, to provide a central location for information related to my writing and professional activity, and to electronically publish an updated copy of my resume.</p>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, and have worked in the engineering field for close to a decade. Most recently, I registered as a general contractor in the State of Rhode Island, and launched <a href="https://gpsolutions.llc">Gagnon Property Solutions (GPS)</a>, offering a range of construction and property maintenance services.</p>
    <p>I occasionally write articles, when time and opportunity permits. My interests include black swans, structural analysis, programming languages, intelligibility, software documentation, technical debt, citation methods, authenticated publishing in the wake of AI, and distributed version control systems. My most recent column, titled "Water cooler discussion regarding the Washington Bridge", was published in The Providence Journal and Yahoo News. A selection of my articles are currently available in draft format at <a href="https://github.com/csgagnon">https://github.com/csgagnon</a>.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a> with any inquiries you may have.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Christopher Gagnon</p>
