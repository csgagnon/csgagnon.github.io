<p>Gagnon Property Solutions (GPS) is a single-member LLC that is owned and operated by myself, Christopher Gagnon. I graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, and have worked in the engineering field for close to a decade. In July of 2024, I resigned from my most recent position at General Dynamics Electric Boat and began work on starting the business.</p>
